## !!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!

This project has been permanently moved to Codeberg
([genai-lib](https://codeberg.org/dinofp/genai-lib)) and is no longer actively
maintained on Github. Do not use the Issues system on Github to report to us.
Don't bother forking or getting source from here as it will not be updated.

Microsoft is not a friend of open-source and we do ourselves a disservice
giving them this impressive power over our work.

Never forget 2020 when Github (a Microsoft product) removed the popular
open-source `youtube-dl` project, sparking enormous controversy. The issue is
not that pushback eventually prompted reinstatement - Github can and will act
like this against us at any time.
